The 2021 WIDS Texas Datathon asked participants to predict hourly electricity usage for the 8 ECORT regions of the Texas power grid for one week in June 2021.  I used this opportunity as a chance to develop a machine learning project while working under a deadline.  My final predictions scored in the top 25% of the finishers, and I was awarded an "Open Source Excellence Award" for my submitted Jupyter notebook which contained my code and project explanation.  I presented my project, along with the other winners, during the awards presentation webinar.  If you would like to view my presentation, advance to timestamp 49:40 in this YouTube video of the webinar:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JTcAUgo5S4
